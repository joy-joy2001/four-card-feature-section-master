## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My learning approach to CSS Grid was very haphazard compared to when I was learning Flexbox. I just looked at W3school and experimented and copied the code without getting into the nitty gritty understanding. I know this was a very poor way to learn CSS Grid especially since it is more difficult than CSS Flexbox. 

### Continued development

Obviously, going to become a serious candidate and revise over the CSS Grid model. Will also redo this project again with SASS since I've done some learning on it. I feel like I could have put more effort into this project!
